# üõ°Ô∏è Ludus Cyber Range Configs

Welcome to the **Ludus Cyber Range Configs** repository! This project contains configuration files, deployment scripts, and notes for a private cyber range hosted on a local BeeLink PC using the [Ludus](https://github.com/ludus-env/ludus) cyber range framework. The goal is to simulate and test various cyber attack techniques in a safe, controlled environment, and analyze their associated logs across different systems and services.

## Purpose

This lab is designed for:

- Practicing offensive security techniques (Red Teaming)
- Capturing logs from various sources (e.g., host, network, application)
- Gaining deeper understanding of attacker TTPs and their footprints

This Github repository specifically holds my custom configurations for different ranges that do not come default with Ludus.
